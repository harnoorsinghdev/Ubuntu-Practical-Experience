Difference between Halt and shutdown

    halt instructs the hardware to stop all CPU functions, but leaves it in a powered-on state. This usually means someone has 
    to reboot or shut the machine down manually by pressing the power button afterwards. The specific way to achieve this is
    architecture specific, but for instance the x86 instruction set provides the HLT instructions which halts the central
    processing unit (CPU) until the next external interrupt is fired.

    poweroff, like halt, stops the CPU but also sends an ACPI hardware signal which will instruct the system to commence with
    a complete and immediate shutdown. This is roughly equivalent to pressing the power button on a typical desktop computer.

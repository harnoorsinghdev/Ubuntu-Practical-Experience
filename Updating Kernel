GUI METHOD
1. To check version of your current kernel
uname -sr
My was Linux 4.04.0-42-generic
2. To download debian file for latest kernel
 http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa

 $ sudo dpkg -i *.deb
 
 And thatâ€™s it. You are now using a much more recent kernel version than the one installed by default with Ubuntu.

apt-cache search linux-image

Then type sudo apt-get install linux-image-<latest version>
